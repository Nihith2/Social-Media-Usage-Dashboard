# Social Media-Usage
For my recent project, I worked with a Kaggle dataset focused on social media usage, specifically analyzing data from Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp. The first step in the process was to clean and structure the raw data, which I accomplished using Tableau Prep. This involved handling missing values, standardizing formats, and transforming the data into a format that was ready for detailed analysis. By ensuring the data was accurate and well-organized, I set the foundation for effective visualization and exploration of trends.

After cleaning the data, I moved on to Tableau to perform the analysis and create dynamic visualizations. I focused on building interactive dashboards that would allow users to explore and gain insights into social media behavior and platform performance. I applied several techniques, including trend analysis to identify usage patterns over time, and user engagement analysis to assess how users interact with content on each platform. Additionally, I conducted platform performance analysis to compare key metrics like engagement and activity on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp.

Throughout the project, I used a combination of tools and skills to transform raw data into meaningful insights. The tools I employed included:

Tableau Prep – For cleaning, structuring, and transforming the dataset.
Tableau – For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
Kaggle – For accessing and using the dataset related to social media usage.
Excel – For performing preliminary data analysis and calculations.
Python (Optional) – For additional data manipulation (if used in your process).
Google Sheets (Optional) – For organizing and reviewing data before import into Tableau.
My key skills included:

Data Cleaning – Handling missing values, transforming data, and preparing it for analysis using Tableau Prep.
Data Visualization – Creating clear and insightful visualizations that communicate data effectively using Tableau.
Dashboard Creation – Building interactive and user-friendly dashboards to display key metrics and insights.
Trend Analysis – Analyzing data trends to uncover patterns in user activity and engagement.
User Engagement Analysis – Assessing how users interact with content on social media platforms.
Platform Performance Analysis – Comparing and analyzing the performance of Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp based on engagement metrics.
Data Transformation – Converting raw data into a structured format that is ready for detailed analysis.
Data Interpretation – Drawing actionable insights and conclusions from visualized data.
Statistical Analysis – (Optional) Applying basic statistical techniques to interpret data patterns (if used).
Problem-Solving – Addressing data issues, finding solutions for missing or inconsistent data, and identifying trends.
Time Series Analysis – Identifying and analyzing patterns in data over time, particularly for trend analysis across social media platforms.
User Experience Design – Ensuring dashboards are intuitive and provide easy navigation and interaction for end-users.
Conclusion:
This project provided me with a valuable opportunity to apply various data science techniques, from data cleaning to visualization and trend analysis. The experience allowed me to gain deeper insights into how social media platforms are used and how to transform raw data into actionable business intelligence. The interactive dashboards I created not only showcased the power of Tableau in visualizing complex data but also honed my skills in working with large datasets and deriving meaningful conclusions. Overall, this project has been a significant step forward in my data science journey, reinforcing the importance of data-driven decision-making in today's digital world.
